# **Pull Request Review: Best Practices**

1.  Understand the Context:

    -   Start by understanding the purpose of the pull request.

    -   Read the description, related issues, and any relevant
        documentation.

    -   Consider the impact of the changes on the overall system.


2.  **Review the Code**:

    -   Examine the code changes carefully:

        -   Look for logical errors, security vulnerabilities, and
            performance issues.

        -   Check adherence to coding standards, style guidelines, and
            best practices.

        -   Ensure proper error handling and edge case coverage.

    -   Use tools like linters and static analyzers to catch common
        issues.

3.  **Test the Changes Locally**:

    -   Pull down the branch locally and test the changes.

    -   Verify that the feature works as expected and doesn't introduce
        regressions.

    -   Run unit tests, integration tests, and any relevant end-to-end
        tests.

4.  **Provide Constructive Feedback**:

    -   Be respectful and specific in your comments.

    -   Focus on the code, not the person.

    -   Suggest improvements, offer alternatives, and ask questions.

    -   Praise well-implemented solutions.

5.  **Consider the Bigger Picture**:

    -   Think about the long-term impact of the changes.

    -   Consider maintainability, scalability, and extensibility.

    -   Evaluate whether the solution aligns with the project's goals.

6.  **Look Beyond the Code**:

    -   Check documentation, comments, and commit messages.

    -   Ensure that the PR includes relevant tests and documentation
        updates.

    -   Verify that dependencies are handled correctly.

7.  **Collaborate with the Author**:

    -   Engage in a dialogue with the author.

    -   Address their concerns and answer their questions.

    -   Encourage them to make necessary adjustments.

8.  **Approve or Request Changes**:

    -   If satisfied, approve the PR.

    -   If not, request changes and explain the reasons.

    -   Use GitHub's review features (e.g., line comments, approvals).

9.  **Avoid Nitpicking**:

    -   Focus on significant issues rather than minor style preferences.

    -   Prioritize correctness and functionality over aesthetics.

10.  **Learn from Each Review**:

    -   Use reviews as a learning opportunity.

    -   Understand different approaches and techniques.

    -   Share knowledge with your team.
        
## **Tips for Authors (PR Submitters)**

-   **Make Smaller Pull Requests**:

    -   Break down complex changes into smaller, focused PRs.

    -   Easier for reviewers to understand and provide feedback.


-   **Be Responsive**:

    -   Address reviewer comments promptly.

    -   Engage in discussions and iterate on the code.

    -   Remember, effective pull request reviews contribute to code
        quality, collaboration, and a smoother development process.
